Visualization in HCI Final Project

Things left to be done:

- Correct Movie JSON Data read in

- ROI Bars
    - These will need their own scale 
    - The SVG size will need to change too so that the bars can fit (or just made the margin.left size a bit bigger)

- Legend

- Correct coding for each circle
    - Inside circles their attributes should reflect the coding we talked about
    
- Producer/Director information
    - Did we say we're going to do the squares? 
    - These can be done pretty similiarly to the circles if so
    - We'll need to alter SVG size and margin.right so that these will fit 

- Filter switches
    - Did we still want to use the filters?
    
- Hover action
    - Needs to probably be a separate function call in itself 

- CSS Styling
